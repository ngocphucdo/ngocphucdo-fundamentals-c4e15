Q1: what is Boolean is?
A1: A Boolean value is either true or false. It is named after the British mathematician, George
Boole, who first formulated Boolean algebra — some rules for reasoning about and combining
these values. This is the basis of all modern computer logic.
In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False (the capitalization must be exactly as
shown), and the Python type is bool.

ex1: import random
 
male = False
male = bool(random.randint(0, 1))
 
print (male)

ex1.2: >>> 5 == (3 + 2) 
True
>>> 5 == 6
False

ex1.3: >>> age = 18
>>> old_enough_to_get_driving_licence = age >= 17
>>> print(old_enough_to_get_driving_licence)
True
>>> type(old_enough_to_get_driving_licence)

Q2: what is flowchart?
A2: A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the
steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic 
representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem.

Q3: what is Nested conditionals?
A3: One conditional can also be nested within another. For example, assume we have two integer variables, x and y.
The following pattern of selection shows how we might decide how they are related to each other.

Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals:
x = int(input("Nhap x = "))
y = int(input("Nhap y = "))
if x < y:
    print("x nho hon y")
else:
    if x > y:
        print("x lon hon y")
    else:
        print("x bang y")
